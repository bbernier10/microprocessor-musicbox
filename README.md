# Microprocessor Musicbox

Final project for ECE 3520, Microprocessors

Coded by [Brandon Bernier](mailto:bbernier@gwu.edu) 

A music and lightshow project based on the Atmel AT90S4414 microprocessor and board assembled for ECE 3520 at GW. The project plays four different songs through the onboard speaker: Mario Bros. Theme, Heart and Soul, Jingle Bells, and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.

## Usage

The code was written to the AT90S4414 microprocessor using the STK500 board. Once the code is written to the board, a 4-digit passcode (0000) must be entered to enable the musicbox. Once enabled, press switch 1 to enter the music mode, at which point any of the four switches on the board will begin playing one of the four songs stored in program memory.
